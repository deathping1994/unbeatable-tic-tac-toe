 My previously made 'dumb tic tac toe ai' which plays randomly have grown up, into a 'smart tic tac toe ai'. I fed him the 'minimax algorithm'.

Click on 'Play as'  button, to play as 'X or 'O'
 After the game gets over you can keep playing   as 'X' or 'O' again and again. 
Press 'Play as' button again, if you want  to change play as.

Note : For the very first move, you have wait for 2-3 seconds.
After first move, you don't have to wait, the computer will play instantly.
